# Ramadhan Heru

> _"I don’t follow the docs — sometimes I rewrite them."_ 

Hey there 👋  
I’m **Ramadhan Heru**, a full-stack tinkerer who mixes **Laravel**, **Vue**, and a little bit of crazy madness ⚡ to turn caffeine into production-grade systems.  

### 🌴 Legacy Project — *My Palm Co*
The journey started with **My Palm Co** — a bold move to digitize plantation performance.  
What began as a simple dashboard turned into a data ecosystem that reshaped how field performance is tracked, analyzed, and predicted.  

- 🌱 Real-time **On Farm Performance** monitoring  
- 🛰️ Integration with sensors, reports, and BigQuery  
- 🤖 Predictive insights powered by custom-built pipelines  
- 🧩 Modular system design that still scales like a beast  

> _My Palm Co was never just an app — it was proof that data can grow trees._ 🌴💡
