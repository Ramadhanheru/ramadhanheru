# 🧠 Ramadhan Heru — Code Alchemist

> _"I don’t follow the docs — sometimes I rewrite them."_ 😎

Hey there 👋  
I’m **Ramadhan Heru**, a full-stack tinkerer who mixes **Laravel**, **Vue**, and a bit of madness ⚡ to turn caffeine into production-grade systems.  

When I’m not shipping features or breaking builds at 3 AM, I’m probably:  
- 🧩 Designing data pipelines that actually work  
- 🧠 Teaching my AI models to behave (they rarely do)  
- 🧱 Building dashboards that make spreadsheets jealous  
- 🧭 Experimenting with architecture until it screams “elegant chaos”

### 🧰 Tech Playground
`Laravel` · `Vue` · `React` · `TypeScript` · `BigQuery` · `Python` · `Tailwind` · `Node.js` · `Three.js`  
…and whatever else looks fun to break today.

### 🌴 Legacy Project — *My Palm Co*
The journey started with **My Palm Co** — a bold move to digitize plantation performance.  
What began as a simple dashboard turned into a data ecosystem that reshaped how field performance is tracked, analyzed, and predicted.  

- 🌱 Real-time **On Farm Performance** monitoring  
- 🛰️ Integration with sensors, reports, and BigQuery  
- 🤖 Predictive insights powered by custom-built pipelines  
- 🧩 Modular system design that still scales like a beast  

> _My Palm Co was never just an app — it was proof that data can grow trees._ 🌴💡

### 🧨 Random Dev Facts
- Writes better code with lo-fi beats on repeat  
- Believes “console.log” is a debugging lifestyle, not a habit  
- Once spent 4 hours debugging a missing semicolon — and still laughed about it  
- Favorite commit message: `fix: idk why but it works now`
